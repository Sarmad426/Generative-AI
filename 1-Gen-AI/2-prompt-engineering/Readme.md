# Prompt Engineering

**Prompt Engineering** is the process of refining prompts that a person can input into a generative artificial intelligence (AI) service to generate text or images. It involves selecting the right words, phrases, symbols, and formats that guide the model in generating high-quality and relevant texts. The goal of prompt engineering is to create effective prompts that can help users achieve their desired outcomes and improve the performance of AI models.

## LLMS

**LLM** stands for Large Language Model. These models are trained using data of different types to produce
outputs. There are two types of LLMS.

1. Base LLMS
2. Instruction Tuned LLMS

## Base LLMS

Base LLMS predict next word based on text training data.

## Instruction Tuned LLMS

Follows Instructions.They are safe, helpful and honest. They use **RLHF** Reinforcement Learning with human feedback.

## Key Concepts

### Inferring

Deducing or concluding using evidence or reasoning. In AI, inferring is making decisions based on available information or data.

### Summarizing

Reducing a large amount of text to its essential information. It involves identifying the most important points and presenting them concisely.

### Iterative Approach

A method of solving problems by repeating a cycle of operations until the desired outcome is achieved. In prompt engineering, it involves refining prompts over time to improve accuracy and effectiveness.

### Transforming

Changing the format or structure of data. In prompt engineering, transforming involves converting prompts into a format compatible with the AI model.

### Expanding

Adding more information or detail to a prompt. In prompt engineering, expanding involves adding more context or specificity to improve accuracy and effectiveness.

## Best Practices for Software Developers

As a software developer, you can become a good prompt engineer by following some best practices:

- Be specific, descriptive, and detailed about the desired context, outcome, length, format, style, etc.

- Use clear and concise language to ensure prompt effectiveness.

- Include relevant context to aid model understanding.

- Use examples to articulate the desired output format.

- Start with zero-shot, then few-shot, and finally fine-tune the model.

## Best Use Cases

Some of the best use cases for prompt engineering include:

- Organized data generation
- Content creation
- Coding assistance
- Chatbot therapy

## Tools and Platforms

To build a chatbot, you can use a platform like [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/), which provides tools and services for building, testing, and deploying chatbots across multiple channels. Additionally, natural language processing (NLP) can be used to enable chatbots to understand and respond to user queries more accurately and effectively.
