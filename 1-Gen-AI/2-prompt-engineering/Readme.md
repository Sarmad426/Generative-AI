# Prompt Engineering

**Prompt Engineering** is the process of refining prompts that a person can input into a generative artificial intelligence (AI) service to generate text or images. It involves selecting the right words, phrases, symbols, and formats that guide the model in generating high-quality and relevant texts. The goal of prompt engineering is to create effective prompts that can help users achieve their desired outcomes and improve the performance of AI models.

## Best Practices

- Be specific, descriptive, and detailed about the desired context, outcome, length, format, style, etc.

- Use clear and concise language to ensure prompt effectiveness.

- Include relevant context to aid model understanding.

- Use examples to articulate the desired output format.

- Start with zero-shot, then few-shot, and finally fine-tune the model.
