# Generative AI

It is a subfield of AI. These are AI systems that create new content, such as images, text or audio. In context of AI these systems are called **Models**. It falls under the category of unsupervised learning.

Generative AI models are trained on extensive datasets, where they learn to recognize patterns and structures present in the training data. These models find applications in diverse areas, including image synthesis, text generation, and music composition.

## Models

- LLM's (Large Language Models)
- Diffusion Models

### LLM's

LLM's are used for textual data and studied under **NLP** (Natural Language Processing).

**Example:**

- **GPT** (Generative Pretrained Transformer)

### Diffusion Models

Diffusion models are used for images specifically and are studied under **Computer Vision**.

**Example:**

- **Dall-e-2**
- **Dall-e-3**
