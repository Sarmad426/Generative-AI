# Generative AI

**Generative AI** is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the use of machine learning models to generate new data resembling the patterns in the training data. It falls under the category of unsupervised learning and is particularly valuable for creating novel content such as images, videos, music, and text.

Generative AI models are trained on extensive datasets, where they learn to recognize patterns and structures present in the training data. These models find applications in diverse areas, including image synthesis, text generation, and music composition.

## Popular fields of Generative AI

- **NLP**
- **Computer Vision**

### NLP

Natural Language Processing. Refers to the use of machine learning models to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. NLP models can be used for a variety of tasks, including text generation, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

- OpenAI's ChatGPT
- Google's Gemini
- Meta's Llama

are the common examples of NLP models.

### Computer Vision

Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual information from the real world. Computer vision models can be used for a variety of tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image generation.

- OpenAI's DALL-E
- NVIDIA's StyleGAN
- Google's DeepDream

are the common examples of Computer Vision models.
