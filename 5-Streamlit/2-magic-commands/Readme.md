# Streamlit magic commands

Magic commands are a feature in Streamlit that allows you to write almost anything (markdown, data, charts) without having to type an explicit command at all. Just put the thing you want to show on its own line of code, and it will appear in your app.

```python
# Draw a title and some text to the app:
'''
# This is the document title

This is some _markdown_.
'''

import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1,2,3]})
df  # ðŸ‘ˆ Draw the dataframe

x = 10
'x', x  # ðŸ‘ˆ Draw the string 'x' and then the value of x

# Also works with most supported chart types
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

arr = np.random.normal(1, 1, size=100)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(arr, bins=20)

fig  # ðŸ‘ˆ Draw a Matplotlib chart
```
