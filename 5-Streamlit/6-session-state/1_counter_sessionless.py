Counter without Session State
No matter how many times we press the Increment button in 
the above app, the count remains at 1. Let's understand why:

Each time we press the Increment button, Streamlit reruns 
counter_without_session.py from top to bottom, and with every run, count 
gets initialized to 0 .

Pressing Increment subsequently adds 1 to 0, thus count=1
no matter how many times we press Increment.

import streamlit as st

increment = st.button("Increment")
if increment:
    count += 1

st.write("Count = ", count)
