# Structured Data in Data Science

## Introduction

Structured data refers to data that is organized and formatted in a consistent and predefined manner. It is typically represented in tabular form, with rows representing individual records and columns representing attributes. Structured data is commonly found in relational databases, spreadsheets, and CSV files. In the context of data science, structured data plays a crucial role in various analytical tasks, including exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.

## Characteristics of Structured Data

1. **Tabular Format**: rows and columns, easy to query and analyze.

2. **Consistency**: Data elements within structured data follow a predefined format and adhere to specific data types, ensuring consistency and uniformity.

3. **Schema**: Structured data often comes with a predefined schema that describes the structure of the data, including the names, types, and constraints of its attributes.

4. **Query ability**: Structured data allows for efficient querying using standard database query languages such as SQL, enabling easy retrieval and manipulation of data.

## Types of Structured Data

Structured data can be further classified into different types based on its characteristics and usage:

### 1. **Numerical Data**

integers, floats, and percentages.

### 2. **Nominal Data (Categorical)**

- Categorical data represents qualitative variables that belong to a specific category or group. Examples include gender, marital status, and product categories.

### 3. **Ordinal Data**

- Ordinal data is a type of categorical data where the categories have a natural ordering or hierarchy. Examples include survey responses (e.g., "strongly agree," "agree," "neutral," "disagree," "strongly disagree").

### 4. **Temporal Data**

- Temporal data represents date and time values. Examples include timestamps, dates, and time durations.

### 5. **Boolean Data**

- Binary values that represent true or false conditions. It is commonly used for binary classification tasks and logical operations.

### 6. **Text Data**

- Text data consists of unstructured or semi-structured textual information. It requires preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and vectorization to make it suitable for analysis.

## Conclusion

Structured data is a fundamental component of data science, providing a well-organized and consistent format for storing and analyzing data. By understanding the characteristics and types of structured data, data scientists can effectively manipulate, analyze, and derive insights from diverse datasets in various domains.
