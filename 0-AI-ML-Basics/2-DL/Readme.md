# Deep Learning

Deep Learning is the subfield of **Machine Learning**. It focuses on *Neural Networks* to develop learning models. It uses Neural Networks with multiple layers to understand and process complex patterns.

## Neural Networks

Neural Networks are systems inspired by human brains that consists of interconnected nodes organized in layers. Info passes through these and network learns by adjusting weights to make accurate predictions or classifications. It's like a digital brain for machines.

**Simplified Explanation:**

Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes or **neurons** organized in layers. Each neuron layer takes an input performs a mathematical operation on it and passes the output to the following layer. Whereas the output of every layer is the input to the layer next to it.
