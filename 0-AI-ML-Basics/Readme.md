# Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computer systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. In essence, machine learning allows computers to improve their performance on a task by learning from experience, making it a critical component of many AI applications.

### Types OF ML

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning


## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a machine learning approach in which the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where each data point is associated with the correct output or target. The primary objective of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from input data to output data, effectively mimicking a "teacher" who provides guidance during training.

### Key Characteristics

- **Training Data**: Labeled data (input-output pairs).
- **Objective**: Predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs.
- **Examples**: Classification (e.g., image recognition), regression (e.g., price prediction).

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning approach where the algorithm is tasked with discovering patterns or structures within the data without explicit labels or targets. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning algorithms explore the inherent structure and relationships within the data.

### Characteristics

- **Training Data**: Unlabeled data.
- **Objective**: Discover hidden patterns, clusters, or relationships.
- **Examples**: Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation), dimensionality reduction (e.g., Principal Component Analysis).

### Comparison

Here's a tabular representation of the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning:

| Aspect                | Supervised Learning                        | Unsupervised Learning                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Training Data         | Labeled data (input-output pairs).         | Unlabeled data.                            |
| Objective             | Predict the correct output for new inputs. | Discover patterns, clusters, or structure. |
| Examples              | Classification, regression.                 | Clustering, dimensionality reduction.      |
| Teacher/Guidance     | "Teacher" provides correct labels during training. | No external guidance or labels provided.   |
| Use Cases            | Image recognition, spam detection, sentiment analysis. | Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, topic modeling. |
